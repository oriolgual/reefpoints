We've all seen the **Motivational Posters**:

I always hear people talk about
**motivation**. *What motivates you?* *I'm lacking motivation.* Well I'm
here to tell you that motivation is bullshit.

Motivation may get you to take on a task or behavior that you don't
normally do but eventually that motivation will either not be there any
more or won't be effective. Then you'll slip, and you justify it by
thinking *"well I just lacked proper motivation"*.

*Motivation* as a concept is a cop-out. If you feel that you need
motivation to accomplish your goals you will likely fail over the
long-term. Instead you should be looking toward discipline.

There is a saying *"it takes 3 weeks for a new behavior to become
habit"*. If you haven't heard that before that's OK because it isn't
true. According to research it actually takes [on average 66 days of
continual behavior to form a
habit](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-clear/forming-new-habits_b_5104807.html).
So ask yourself this. Can you use the same motivation for 66 days in a
row? If not, do you have that many different forms of motivation to form this
new habit over this period of time? I don't think many of us do.

Discipline on the otherhand is you saying to yourself *"I will do this
even if I would prefer to do something else"*. It's not an easy trait to
establish but if you can do so you'll find that making changes happen
more easily. I think many of us have a *will* to overcome existing habits and
form new ones but we lack the *way* to do so. Too many distractions, too
many opportunities, too many excuses. Take a look at successful people
around you. Ask yourself are they successful because of some outside
motivation or are they successful because they've made a conscious
decision they're going to wade through the muck to get what they want.

Focus on being disciplined instead of waiting to be motivated.
