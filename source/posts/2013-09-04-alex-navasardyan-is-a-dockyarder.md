Alex has been friend for a while now, I got to know him when I started
attending the [Boston Ember meetup](www.meetup.com/Boston-Ember-js/).
Alex has been a very active in the Ember.js community and helped with
the 1.0 release last week as well as
[Ember.ListView](http://emberjs.com/list-view/)

We're very dedicated to the future of Ember.js and with Alex on board
we're well on our way to building out one of the best teams around.
