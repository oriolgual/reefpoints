Today I'm happy to announce that Chris Gill is joining our team!
Chris and I worked together at the [DNC](http://dnc.org) and I credit
him with sparking my interest in [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org)

Chris' pragmatic approach to software development and his years of
experience in politics is a huge addition to our growing team. He is
located in DC and we hope to soon build out a team in that area.

Welcome aboard Chris!
