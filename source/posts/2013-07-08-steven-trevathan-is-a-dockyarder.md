I'm very happy to announce today that DockYard has joined forces with
Boston design firm Dobot! Leader designer Steven Trevathan has come on
as a partner and Creative Director (until we come up with a title he
prefers) of DockYard.

This is a huge step forward for us. While we have had in-house designers
we have been actually leaning on Steven from time to time for our
concept design needs. Now with Steven coming on as part of our team he
will focus on building out the design side of DockYard and putting
together a formal concept design process for us.
