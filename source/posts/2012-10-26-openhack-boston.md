Last night we hosted Boston's first
[OpenHack](http://openhack.github.com/)
event.

[Nick Quaranto](http://twitter.com/qrush) started OpenHack at his [CoWorkBuffalo](http://coworkbuffalo.com/) office space,
based upon [BostonRB](http://bostonrb.org)'s former (don't get me
started) Hackfests. The idea is pretty simple: a quiet space with food,
drinks, and wifi is provided. Developers show up and hack on some
software for a few hours.

On 2-day notice we had 11 in attendance and all around everyone had a
very productive night. Currently our office maxes out at 20 chairs so until we buy more
we cannot accept over 20, but next month we will open the
event to a wider audience. We want to welcome more than just Ruby devs
(with the exception of 2 all were Ruby devs) to the event.

announcements.
