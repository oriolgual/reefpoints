It's common in Rails to use a `has_many :through` relationship to model User/Group Memberships. 
Sometimes we have extra data in the join that we would like to make use of, but getting that 
data in there can be combersome depending on our approach. For example, given the
following diagram and schema:

![Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/8JgW3es.png)

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Schema.define(:version => 20120324170519) do
  create_table "groups", :force => true do |t|
    t.string   "name"
    t.datetime "created_at", :null => false
    t.datetime "updated_at", :null => false
  end

  create_table "memberships", :force => true do |t|
    t.integer  "user_id"
    t.integer  "group_id"
    t.string   "role"
    t.datetime "created_at", :null => false
    t.datetime "updated_at", :null => false
  end

  create_table "users", :force => true do |t|
    t.string   "name"
    t.datetime "created_at", :null => false
    t.datetime "updated_at", :null => false
  end
end
```

We might deal directly with the join table to assign our additonal data.

```ruby
@user = User.create(name: 'User 1')
@user = Group.create(name: 'Group 1')
@membership = Membership.create do |m|
  m.user = @user
  m.group = @group
  m.role = 'admin'
end
@user.admin? # => true
@user.editor? # => false
```

There's a better way to pull this off ...

```ruby
@group.admins << @user
@user.admin? # => true
@user.editor? # => false
```

And this is how it's done ...

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :memberships
  has_many :groups, :through => :memberships

  def admin?
    memberships.where(:role => 'admin').first
  end

  def editor?
    memberships.where(:role => 'editor').first
  end
end
```

```ruby
class Membership < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :group
  belongs_to :user
end
```

```ruby
class Group < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :memberships
  has_many :users, :through => :memberships

  has_many :admins, :through => :memberships, :source => :user,
    :conditions => "memberships.role = 'admin'" do
      def <<(admin)
        proxy_association.owner.memberships.create(:role => 'admin', :user => admin)
      end
  end

  has_many :editors, :through => :memberships, :source => :user,
    :conditions => "memberships.role = 'editor'" do
      def <<(editor)
        proxy_association.owner.memberships.create(:role => 'editor', :user => editor)
      end
  end
end
```

We're defining an extension on our group's `has_many` association which overrides
the `<<` method on that collection. We then tell the proxy association's owner
(which is our group object) to create the user/group join record, but with an additional
role assignment of 'admin'.

```ruby
@group.admins << @user
@user.admin? # => true
@user.editor? # => false
```

Pretty expressive, thanks to ActiveRecord!

```ruby
require 'test_helper'

class GroupTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  setup do
    @user_1 = User.create(name: 'User 1')
    @user_2 = User.create(name: 'User 2')
    @user_3 = User.create(name: 'User 3')
    @group = Group.create(name: 'Group 1')
  end

  test "No Memberships" do
    assert_equal @user_1.memberships.count, 0
  end

  test "@group.users << @user_1 sets nil role on membership" do
    @group.users << @user_1
    assert_equal @user_1.memberships.count, 1
    assert_equal @user_1.memberships.first.role, nil
  end

  test "@group.admins << @user_2 sets 'admin' role on membership" do
    @group.admins << @user_2
    assert_equal @user_2.memberships.count, 1
    assert_equal @user_2.memberships.first.role, 'admin'
  end

  test "@group.editors << @user_3 sets 'editor' role on membership" do
    @group.editors << @user_3
    assert_equal @user_3.memberships.count, 1
    assert_equal @user_3.memberships.first.role, 'editor'
  end

  teardown do
    User.delete_all
    Group.delete_all
    Membership.delete_all
  end
end
```
