Lin comes to us from Alaska. Normally that is all that you need to say
but Lin also brought us jerked-bear (actual Alaskan black bear) on his first day with us as an
intern. From there it was easy street. Lin's published his own
[gem](https://github.com/dockyard/stashable_params),
contributed back to several of our projects, and has been expanding his
developer horizons with Ember over the past few months. He is also the
*co-founder* of [Pizza Time](http://pizza-time.herokuapp.com)
