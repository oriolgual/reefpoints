to join DockYard as a Senior Developer. It was the best decision I could have made.</p>

<p>When I announced my resignation to my previous employer, he jokingly said that if
they had known choosing Ember as a new client-side framework would
eventually make me want to pursue a new Ember-focused opportunity, they would
have chosen Angular.</p>

<p>I first started dipping my toes into Ember in late Spring 2013, some time after
Ember 1.0 RC3 was released. The Ember.js community was undeniably very active and
vibrant. That following June, I attended my first Boston Ember meetup,
where <a href="https://twitter.com/dgeb">Dan Gebhardt</a> shared tips on testing Ember apps,
and <a href="https://twitter.com/twokul">Alex Navasardyan</a> gave an introduction to Ember Data.
That&#39;s how I came to know of DockYard.</p>

<p>Soon, some names started to emerge as familiar names within the
community. <a href="https://twitter.com/bcardarella">Brian Cardarella</a> became
known within our dev team as the one who wrote
<a href="https://github.com/dockyard/ember-validations">ember-validations</a>,
which we were using in our application. <a href="https://twitter.com/rwjblue">Robert
Jackson</a> was another name that kept popping
up on my Twitter and GitHub feeds. Call me a nerd if you will, but I was
as excited to have The Robert Jackson accept a fix that I submitted to
<a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember-dev">ember-dev</a> later that year to make builds
pass on Windows (with Rake at the time) as I would have been meeting a film celebrity.</p>

<p>DockYard further reinforced its reputation by organizing the Wicked Good Ember
conference in Boston, in June of 2014, which I of course attended.</p>

<p>Needless to say, when Brian reached out to me last July about joining the team, I
saw it as an opportunity that was really hard to pass on. Logistically,
I may have been better off staying where I was. I had a 40 min commute.
Joining DockYard would have doubled my commuting time. I was also
comfortable with the position I was holding, building out cool D3.js
charts with Ember, leading the development of new products, and getting
myself involved in all kinds of engineering team growth efforts. But
then there was DockYard. I went with my gut feeling instead and left
the warm and comfortable seat to face the exciting, though new and scary thing that was
DockYard.</p>

<p>Scary? Yes. From everything DockYard had done for the Boston community
to the talent behind its wheel, I was absolutely terrified of not
fitting in, that it was too elite for me. I checked out the team page on
the website and read everyone&#39;s biography a number of times,
trying to picture what kind of co-workers I would be interacting with
daily. No matter how great the projects can be, culture is a big thing.
To my delight, the culture at DockYard is one that resonates the
most with me in my 10 years of professional career.</p>

<p>DockYard has a well-balanced team of young, bright minds and more
seasoned developers, and I embrace that. There is none of that &quot;I am
better than you&quot; bullshit. Those I once viewed as Ember Gods and would
have been intimidated to talk to have been incredibly supportive and encouraging.
In the past, whenever I was involved in the hiring process for
Engineering, I had always wondered where all the great developers were.
Well, they&#39;re here, happily employed at places like DockYard. If there
is one thing I can say about the company, it&#39;s that it&#39;s doing something
right to attract an amazingly talented and diverse crew. I&#39;ve been
particularly impressed with our designers. It&#39;s nice as a developer to
work on such nifty UIs!</p>

<p>Doing consultancy work was new to me, and I had been warned about what I was
throwing myself into, that I&#39;d end up losing focus on quality and just
hack solutions together quickly to meet client deadlines. I don&#39;t doubt
that those kinds of situations can creep up, but so far, I&#39;ve found
quite the opposite in the two projects that I&#39;ve been involved in.
People care deeply about delivering clean, maintainable,
and well-tested code, and they&#39;ve been especially adept at maintaining those
principles throughout the life of a project.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also refreshing to be able to work on a diverse portfolio of
projects. In the first few months since joining DockYard, I worked on a Rails and Ember app
that incorporated some really cool geolocation functionality. I am now
working on something that is unlike any other app I have ever developed.
The project includes Arduino code, Ember.js, and Node WebKit
(<a href="http://nwjs.io/">NW.js</a>).</p>

<p>The best, of course, is DockYard&#39;s mindset towards open source. I always
look forward to our &quot;DockYard days&quot; on Fridays to hack on code, blog
(this is my first one!), contribute back to the community in some ways,
or just to level up our craftsmanship.</p>

<p>And as much as everyone works really hard, we also know when to have
fun, be it through Risk game tournaments, friendly games of Carcassonne
(or, as some would say, &quot;Casserole&quot;), or world exploring and building on
Minecraft.</p>

<p>Finding a job that you&#39;ll love can be hard. Finding a team that you&#39;ll
love working with can be twice as hard. And sometimes, it&#39;s okay
to leave behind what is comfortable and secure, in light of
something promising, yet unknown. You may be pleasantly surprised.</p>
